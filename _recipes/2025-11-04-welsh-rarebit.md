## Overview
Welsh rarebit recipe

Serves six (recipe extracted from Fergus Henderson's Nose to Tail Eating, published by Bloomsbury in 2004)

## Ingredients
- Ingredients
- A knob of butter
- 1 tbsp flour
- 1 tsp English mustard powder
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper
- 200ml Guinness
- A very long splash of Worcestershire sauce
- 450g mature strong Cheddar cheese, grated
- 4 pieces of toast

## Method
Melt the butter in a pan, stir in the flour, and let this cook together until it smells biscuity but is not browning. Add the mustard powder and cayenne pepper, stir in the Guinness and Worcestershire sauce, then gently melt in the cheese.

When it's all of one consistency, remove from the heat, pour out into a shallow container and allow to set. Spread on toast 1cm thick and place under the grill. Eat when bubbling golden brown. This makes a splendid savoury at the end of your meal, washed down with a glass of Port, or a steadying snack.

## Notes
Dealer's choice whether "Spread on toast 1cm thick" means the toast is 1cm or the spread. Maybe both? You don't want your toast:spread ratio 1:1 really, that's just overkill.
