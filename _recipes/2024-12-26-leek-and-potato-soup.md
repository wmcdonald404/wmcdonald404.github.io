## Overview
Another version of [leek & potato soup](https://wmcdonald404.co.uk/recipes/2024-11-17-leek-and-potato-soup.html).

- Prep **15 min**
- Cook **50 min**
- Serves **4-6**

## Ingredients
- 50ml olive oil
- 1 onion, peeled and chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled; 2 finely chopped, 2 crushed
- Salt and pepper
- 50g butter
- 500g leeks, cleaned and roughly sliced
- 1 bay leaf
- 400g floury potatoes, peeled and diced into small equal sizes
- 150g double cream

For the crumbs
- 25g ’nduja
- 75g stale bread, blitzed to crumbs


## Method
Warm half the oil in a large, deep pan over a medium heat and add the onion, celery and chopped garlic. Season generously and sweat for 10 minutes before adding the butter, leeks and bay leaf. Continue to sweat for another 10 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and sweet, before adding the potatoes. Stir for five to 10 minutes, scraping any caramelised bits from the bottom of the pan.

Add the cream and 750ml of water, bring to a simmer and cover for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and falling apart.

Meanwhile, warm the rest of the oil in a small frying pan and cook the crushed garlic for three to four minutes, until it begins to colour, then add the ’nduja and push it down with your spoon so it melts into the pan. Stir in the breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt, then fry for a minute or so until the crumbs have absorbed the fat; set aside until ready to serve.

When the potatoes are ready, use a hand blender to blitz the soup smooth. Check and adjust the seasoning, remembering that the crumbs will be salty. Scatter over the crumbs and serve at once.
