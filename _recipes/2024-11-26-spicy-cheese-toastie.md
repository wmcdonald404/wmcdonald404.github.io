# Overview
I love a cheese toastie. The [Simon Hopkinson fried cheese and ham sandwich](https://wmcdonald404.co.uk/recipes/2024-10-21-fried-ham-and-cheese-sandwich.html) is a frequent favourite.

Sometimes I want something a bit quicker, that doesn't mess up a food processor and I had a jar of unopened mango habanero salsa so this seemed like an obvious combo. 

This barely warrants an entry other than to say 'Mix cheese, salsa, make toastie. Consume.'

# Ingredients
- 2 slices of soft-ish bread. Cheap white, or fancy white, brown, whatever takes your fancy. Avoid anything too chewy/crunchy to start.
- Cheese. Sliced medium-thick. I used extra strong mature cheddar, but use whatever  you have.
- Mango habanero salsa. I had [Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero Salsa](https://www.renfrofoods.com/products/mango-habanero-salsa) to hand. Available from [Hot Headz](https://hot-headz.com/sauces/salsas-relishes-jams/salsas-salsas-relishes-jams/mrs-renfros-mango-habanero-salsa/) or the [Hot Sauce Emporium](https://www.hotsauceemporium.co.uk/product/mango-habanero-salsa/) in the UK.
- Butter, salted.

# Method
- Shake the salsa to distribute contents evenly
- Spread a thin layer of salsa on one slice of bread
- Top with slices of cheese
- Top with second slice of bread
- Melt a knob of butter in the pan over a low-medium heat
- Carefully add the toastie to the pan
- Turn every 2-3 minutes, add another knob of butter between the first flip
- Total time will vary but 5-6 minutes

# Notes
I like to make my toasties like a hipster douchebag in seasoned cast iron, I use the lid of the ["forty-dollar pot" (aka The Lodge 3.2-Quart Cast Iron Combo Cooker)](https://www.wired.com/story/rave-lodge-3-quart-cast-iron-combo-cooker/). A few stockists have these in the UK/EU.

For bonus points, you can also add a nice [cast iron steak weight/press](https://www.nisbets.co.uk/steak-weight/cf237), maybe throw on a Filson flannel shirt and cultivate a beard.
